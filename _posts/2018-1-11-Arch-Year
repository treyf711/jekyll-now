title: A Full Year with Arch
---

In 2017, I was absolutely terrible about switching operating systems on my personal computer. I got into lots of different things this year, docker, Monero, and got out of gaming. Every time I felt like trying something different, I would usually completely format my harddrive.

That got old quickly, so as of now I'm happy to say that using LVM and docker-compose I've alleviated the strain of changing operating systems. I can take it one step further though. In 2018 I plan on staying on Arch Linux for the whole year.
